# NetHunter Pro GTK Theme

This directory should contain the NetHunter Pro GTK theme files.

The theme should include:
- `gtk-2.0/` - GTK2 theme files
- `gtk-3.0/` - GTK3 theme files  
- `gtk-4.0/` - GTK4 theme files
- `index.theme` - Theme metadata

The theme should follow NetHunter Pro design principles:
- Dark color scheme with black/dark gray backgrounds
- Green accent colors (#00FF00)
- High contrast for mobile readability
- Touch-friendly button and control sizes

You can obtain these files from the official NetHunter Pro theme package or adapt from existing dark themes like Adwaita-dark.
